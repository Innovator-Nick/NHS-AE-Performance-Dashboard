NHS-AE-Performance-Dashboard
Interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing NHS A&E department performance against the 4-hour waiting time standard across England. Built with real NHS England data covering 12.9M attendances.


Project Overview
This dashboard provides comprehensive analysis of NHS Accident & Emergency (A&E) performance across **188 NHS Trusts** in England, processing *12.9 million patient attendances* over a 3-month period (January - March 2025).

Built to demonstrate:
-Business Intelligence and data visualization skills
-Healthcare analytics and domain knowledge  
-Power BI proficiency (DAX, visualizations, interactivity)
-Data storytelling for stakeholder decision-making

Key Findings:
1)Performance Crisis
-National average: 73.2% against 95% NHS target
-3.4 million patients** experienced waits exceeding 4 hours
-Gap to target: 21.8 percentage points - indicating significant capacity challenges
-Only 27% of trusts currently meeting the standard

2)Positive Trends
-2 percentage point improvement from January (72.4%) to March (74.4%)
-Suggests recovery from winter pressures
-Month-over-month momentum building

3)Regional Disparities
-Up to 10 percentage point variation between best and worst performing regions
-Highlights opportunities for best practice sharing
-Enables targeted resource allocation
